# AutoBahn

This repository is a simple form to manage 3 fields (input-text, select, checkbox) with validations and fills the data from DB.
The design was made using material design.
It was created to manage a user session without login, and it uses uuid library to generate a random identification.

The BE manages all the validations, and reports by console and JSON all the status codes available.  
Additionally, a CORS control was added because it is required by the hosting server for this app.

 Automated tests are covering all modules.


## Technical details

The Front-End was developed using REACTJS, JEST and SASS.
The Back-End was made on NodeJS using the ExpressJS framework and MySQL.

The Back-End and Front-End have their own dependencies package and runners under NPM.
